# Carbon-relay has several options for metric routing controlled by RELAY_METHOD

# Use relay-rules.conf to route metrics to destinations based on pattern rules

# Use consistent-hashing for even distribution of metrics between destinations
#RELAY_METHOD = consistent-hashing
#
# Use consistent-hashing but take into account an aggregation-rules.conf shared
# by downstream carbon-aggregator daemons. This will ensure that all metrics
# that map to a given aggregation rule are sent to the same carbon-aggregator
# instance.
# Enable this for carbon-relays that send to a group of carbon-aggregators

# This is a list of carbon daemons we will send any relayed or
# generated metrics to. The default provided would send to a single
# carbon-cache instance on the default port. However if you
# use multiple carbon-cache instances then it would look like this:
#
# DESTINATIONS = 127.0.0.1:2004:a, 127.0.0.1:2104:b
#
# The general form is IP:PORT:INSTANCE where the :INSTANCE part is
# optional and refers to the "None" instance if omitted.
#
# Note that if the destinations are all carbon-caches then this should
# exactly match the webapp's CARBONLINK_HOSTS setting in terms of
# instances listed (order matters!).
#
# If using RELAY_METHOD = rules, all destinations used in relay-rules.conf
# must be defined in this list
#
